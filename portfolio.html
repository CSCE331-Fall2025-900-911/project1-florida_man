<h3>Spotify Map</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Web application that generates a 3D-visual map of the co-occurrences between Spotify Playlists to find recommendations for a user. 
        Implemented using the Node2Vec Python algorithm and Spotify’s integrated API and authentication. Our team is currently looking at other graph
         algorithms to increase scalability.</li>

<h3>Aggie Parts Picker</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Using a database that’s automatically populated with recipe information, alongside its generated embedding, from web scraping websites in 
order to use RAG to create an AI model that can intuitively respond to text queries from the users about recipes of interest. The AI model then 
outputs recipe information that can be sorted into meal plans (ingredients from stores or restaurants), which are then sorted into the user’s school
 schedule, adjusting for travel time and distance using Google Maps API. This project is a web app created using React.</li>
