                <p>Howdy! I'm Orlando Haye, a passionate Junior Computer Science Major attending Texas A&M University. I am from Houston, TX, and I enjoy
                   building or being a part of full stack projects and constantly learning new technologies. I have a passion for Artificial Intelligence because
                   the idea of intelligent machines and futuristic technologies inspires me to explore how AI can be applied in real-world scenarios. One area I‚Äôm especially excited about is medical technology, because it shows how innovation in AI can directly improve lives through better healthcare and accessibility. Furthermore, this curiosity
                   evolved from my interest in robotics and science fiction that imagined advanced technology changing the world. Over time, I realized that AI is not just a futuristic dream but an active field with countless opportunities for innovation.<br> <br>
My interest in technology started at an early age where I was always interested in video games and how they worked behind the scenes. This grew into programming experiments, small projects, and the slow discovery of joy through problem solving through code. Troubleshooting always felt like conversing with the computer, and new concepts fueled my curiosity even more. Thus, I knew Computer Science was the right path for me. <br> <br>
When I‚Äôm not coding, you can usually find me watching and playing basketball, skateboarding with friends, producing music (my favorite genre is hip-hop), or playing video games. These hobbies keep me creative and remind me of the values that teamwork, persistence and experimentation offer. <br> <br>
I‚Äôve always wanted to become a developer, and very class, project, or collaboration brings me closer to that goal. Whether it‚Äôs backend, frontend, full stack, cloud, or game development, I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and expressing creativity through technology. In the future, I hope to use my skills to contribute to innovative AI solutions, work on impactful projects, and inspire others who share the same passion. I‚Äôm Orlando, and I could be your new favorite developer!
